# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter to uncover trends. 

Data from this analysis is from 2014 to 2016. We used [Kickstarter data](https://github.com/fobordo/kickstarter-analysis/blob/897c38e46b8bfb5d1c071d5217a07f5ffa570f69/data-1-1-3-StarterBook.xlsx) to find trends, patterns, and insights into Kickstarter campaigns.

During the analysis, various helpful insights were identified, such as:
1. Theatre Kickstarter Outcomes Based on Launch Date
2. US Theatre Kickstarter Outcomes
3. Great Britain Play Kickstarter Outcomes
4. Edinburgh Kickstarter Research
5. Successful vs. Failed US Kickstarters

## 1. Theatre Kickstarter Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Digging into the data, it was found that some kickstarters were more successful than others depending on the launch date.

The "2014-2016 Theatre Kickstarter Outcomes Based on Launch Date" chart above shows that from 2014 to 2016, the most successful kickstarters were launched in May, while the most failed were launched in May, June, July, August, and October. Though 52 theatre kickstarters that launched in May failed, 111 were successful, indicating the chances of success were greater than those of failure. **To increase your chances of a successful kickstarter, we suggest it should be launched in May.**

## 2. US Theatre Kickstarter Outcomes

Next, we looked into US kickstarter outcomes and statistics from 2014 to 2016, and compared theatre against several different categories such as film & video, photography, and technology.

Doing a deepdive into the theatre category, the "2014-2016 US Theatre Kickstarter Outcomes" chart above shows 58% (525 out of 912) theatre kickstarters launched in the US were successful. The theatre kickstarter success rate was comparable to music, which had a 77% success rate, and film & video, which had a 62% success rate.

We found that the success rate of theatre kickstarters in Great Britain were greater, with a success rate of 72% (258 out 359).

## 3. Great Britain Play Kickstarter Outcomes

In the case of play kickstarters in Great Britain, it was found that 76% (238 out 314) launched were successful. Comparing this metric to play kickstarters in the US, it was found that 61% (412 out 671) were successful. These metrics suggest you would have a greater chance of success launching a play kickstarter in Great Britain.

## 4. Edinburgh Kickstarter Research

We also looked into the following five plays from the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, including goals, amounts pledged, average donations, and number of backers.

The "2014-2016 Great Britain Musical Kickstarter Goals and Pledges" box plot above shows that the average campaign goal was around £4000. We would suggest producing a play for less than £4,000 in order for it to be successful.

## 5. Successful vs. Failed US Kickstarters

Finally, we performed a statistical analysis of successful versus failed US kickstarters.

In summary, the main takeaways from this analysis were that successful US kickstarts had an average goal of $5000, while those that failed had an average goal of $10,000. In order to increase your chances of launching a successful kickstarter, we suggest having a campaign goal of around $5000.
